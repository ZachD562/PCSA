PCSA or Personal Cyber Security Assistant is a google chrome extension project developed as part of my final year project at university.

PLEASE NOTE

Due to problems with getting this extention published on the google chrome store this project will have to be downloaded and maually loaded into your google chrome browser if you would like to test and play with this extention yourself. Instructions on how to do so can be found below.


Manual Instalation process:
1. Open a google chrome 
2. Click on the vertical three dots in the top right of the browser
3. Hover over the 'More Tools' menu option and then select 'Extensions' from the sublist
4. Once here, toggle developer mode in the top right of the screen, An option button that reads 'Load Unpacked' will then be shown in the top left 
5. Click the 'Load Unpacked' button and select the uncompressed 'pcsa_extention' file
6. The extention should then be loaded into and can then be enabled and used
